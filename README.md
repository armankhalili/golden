I have started learning Python programming and I add a file to the Golden Repository for each session I practice.
The reason for naming this repository is my educational resource called the Golden Python Learning Package from Daneshjooyar Institute
So it is quite understandable that all these codes are just for my practice and none of them are absolutely worth using.
Of course, if the code is useful to you, you are allowed to use it.
Thank you for taking the time to read this README file.
